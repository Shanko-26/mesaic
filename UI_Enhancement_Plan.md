# MesAIc UI Enhancement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to enhance the MesAIc application user interface, focusing on improved layout, better space utilization, and enhanced functionality. The goal is to create a more intuitive, efficient, and powerful interface for signal data analysis.

## Design Concept

The new UI will follow a three-panel layout:
- Left sidebar for file management and signal selection
- Central area for visualization and plot controls
- Right panel for AI chat and data analysis

All panels will be collapsible to maximize screen real estate when needed, with a bottom bar for annotations and collaboration features.

## Phase 1: Core Layout Structure

### Left Sidebar
- [x] Implement collapsible sidebar container
- [x] Create file upload/selection section
- [x] Add recent files list with thumbnails
- [x] Develop enhanced signal selector with grouping
- [ ] Add search/filter functionality for signals

### Central Visualization Area
- [x] Design integrated plot toolbar
- [x] Implement plot area with responsive sizing
- [x] Add basic zoom and pan controls
- [x] Create cursor positioning system
- [ ] Develop interactive legends

### Right Panel
- [x] Create collapsible AI chat panel
- [x] Implement chat history view
- [x] Develop chat input with suggestions
- [ ] Add context awareness for signals in view
- [ ] Create visual results display in chat

### Bottom Bar
- [x] Implement collapsible annotation bar
- [x] Add collaboration status indicators
- [x] Create scrollable annotation list
- [x] Develop annotation creation interface

## Phase 2: Enhanced Visualization

### Plot Toolbar Enhancements
- [x] Add segmented controls for related functions
- [ ] Implement view presets (save/load configurations)
- [x] Create export options (screenshot, data)
- [ ] Add time range selector/mini timeline
- [ ] Implement split view options

### Plot Area Improvements
- [ ] Enhance interactive legends (click to show/hide)
- [ ] Add data tips/tooltips for hovering
- [ ] Implement on-plot annotations
- [ ] Add grid customization options
- [ ] Support multiple Y-axes for different signal ranges

### Signal Selection Enhancements
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop for signals to plot
- [x] Add signal metadata display
- [x] Create quick action buttons (select all, clear, invert)
- [ ] Add color customization for signals
- [x] Implement signal grouping by categories

## Phase 3: AI Integration

### Chat Interface Improvements
- [ ] Enhance context awareness for queries
- [ ] Add mini visualizations in chat responses
- [x] Implement query templates for common analyses
- [ ] Create history management (save/load/export)
- [ ] Add insight highlighting in responses

### Analysis Tools
- [x] Implement basic statistics display
- [ ] Add FFT analysis for frequency domain
- [ ] Create correlation tools between signals
- [ ] Develop custom formula editor for derived signals
- [ ] Add anomaly detection highlighting

## Phase 4: Collaboration Features

### Annotation System
- [x] Implement categorized annotations
- [ ] Add user attribution for annotations
- [ ] Create timeline view for annotations
- [ ] Add filtering and searching for annotations
- [ ] Implement export/import of annotations

### Multi-user Features
- [x] Add user presence indicators
- [ ] Implement shared cursor options
- [ ] Create real-time updates for collaborative editing
- [ ] Add permissions management
- [ ] Implement change history and versioning

## Phase 5: Performance & Polish

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Implement virtualized lists for large signal collections
- [ ] Add debounced updates for signal selection
- [ ] Optimize plot rendering for large datasets
- [ ] Implement lazy-loading for chat history
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed data

### User Experience Polish
- [ ] Create keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Implement consistent loading states
- [x] Add helpful tooltips throughout interface
- [ ] Create onboarding guidance for new users
- [ ] Implement error handling with recovery options

### Responsive Design
- [x] Ensure proper behavior on different screen sizes
- [ ] Implement touch-friendly controls for mobile
- [ ] Create alternative layouts for narrow screens
- [ ] Add responsive typography
- [ ] Ensure accessibility compliance

## Implementation Progress

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Core Layout Structure | In Progress | Basic prototype implemented with collapsible panels |
